    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A go to interesting dish for Bella, this Asian-Italian fusion pasta has the creaminess from the Parm and the saltiness from the bacon, but the umami from the miso and the chili garlic sauce really give this dish a unique twist. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 TBSP olive oil</li>
        <li>4 OZ thick cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>3 TBSP chili garlic sauce, more to taste</li>
        <li>2 TBSP blond miso</li>
        <li>2 TBSP hot water</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 LB dry bucatini</li>
        <li>2 OZ finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 TSP freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced scallion greens, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot  of generously salted water to a low boil, cover, and keep hot on a low burner. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large skillet, then add the bacon and cook until crisped and the fat is rendered, 9–10 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the chili garlic sauce, miso, and 2 tablespoons of hot water from the boiling pot until smooth, then beat in the eggs. Cook the pasta according to box instructions until al dente and drain, reserving ½ cup of the pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet with the bacon and toss to combine. Heat over medium heat until everything is nice and hot. Add the egg mixture, reduce the heat to low, and quickly toss until the eggs coat the pasta but aren’t scrambled. Add the cheese, pepper, and pasta water as desired until the sauce reaches your desired flavor and consistency. Taste, and add more chili garlic sauce if you like things spicy. Toss in the scallions. Divide among bowls, and garnish with more scallions and Parm.</li>
    </ol>
